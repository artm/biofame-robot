[*] open / close mc when button's pressed
[*] press the button on start
[*] close mc on exit

need "MC_CHECK_RESULT" and a generic system of throwing, logging and catching exceptions.

* * *

displays:
[ ] lcnt
[ ] speed
[ ] input ticks

controls:
[ ] default axis parameters
[ ] stop button
[ ] go cw/ccw buttons
[ ] output ticks

had to prepare motorc like:

PATH=/c/MinGW/bin/:/c/Program\ Files/CMake\ 2.8/bin MAX_SDK_ROOT=~/src/sdk/MaxSDK-5.1.1/ cmake ..
/motorc -G "CodeBlocks - MinGW Makefiles" -DBOOST_ROOT=~/src/sdk/boost_1_44_0/

after which could import the project into Qt Creator

[x] an object encapsulating a motor
    all communication with the motor goes via this object
    it also takes care that state is displayed by the GUI
[x] engage motors on open
    [x] need a way to send outputs to motors
    [x] need to display output states...
    [x] need to connect button group events, not what I have now
[x] without any feedback send stop and continuous motion commands
[x] feedback: want to pick up the axis parameters...
[x] parameter settage
[x] save axis parameters to eprom just before closing...

[x] poll:
    [x] counter
    [x] speed
    [x] inputs

no separate thread yet, just a timer that polls everything important for every motor.

[ ] circular calibration
    [ ] panic button
    [ ] calibrate button
    [ ] axis knows how to calibrate itself
    [ ] input changes send signals or events
