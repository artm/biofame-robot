had to prepare motorc like:

PATH=/c/MinGW/bin/:/c/Program\ Files/CMake\ 2.8/bin MAX_SDK_ROOT=~/src/sdk/MaxSDK-5.1.1/ cmake ..
/motorc -G "CodeBlocks - MinGW Makefiles" -DBOOST_ROOT=~/src/sdk/boost_1_44_0/

after which could import the project into Qt Creator

[x] an object encapsulating a motor
    all communication with the motor goes via this object
    it also takes care that state is displayed by the GUI
[x] engage motors on open
    [x] need a way to send outputs to motors
    [x] need to display output states...
    [x] need to connect button group events, not what I have now
[x] without any feedback send stop and continuous motion commands
[ ] feedback: want to pick up the axis parameters...
